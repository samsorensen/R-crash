## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
print("hello world")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Syntax & Hot-keys

-   Comment with ctrl-shift-c
-   Execute current line with ctrl-enter
-   Execute entire chunk with ctrl-shift-enter

```{r}
my_string <- "hello world"
print(my_string)

7
x <- 1
y <- 2
z <- x + y
```

## R Objects

-   vectors
-   Lists
-   Matrices
-   Arrays
-   Factors
-   Data Frames

### vectors

c - combine function

```{r}
apple <- c("red", "green", "yellow")
print(apple)
print(class(apple))
```

### Lists

Can contain different r-object types

```{r}
list1 <- list(c(2, 5, 3), 21, sin, TRUE)
print(list1)
```

### Matrices

Two dimensional rectangular data set. Can be created using a vector input to the matrix function

```{r}
M = matrix(c('a', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'b', 'a'), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
print(M)
```

### Arrays

Arrays are multi-dimensional data structures. They can be created using the `array` function.

```{r}
# repeats values until dimensions filled
a <- array(c('green', 'yellow'), dim = c(3, 3, 2))
print(a)
```

### Data Frames

Tabular data objects. Created with `data.frame` function. It is a list of vectors of equal length. Each column can be a different type.

```{r}
BMI <- data.frame(
  Gender = factor(c("Male", "Female", "Male")),
  Height = c(1.75, 1.60, 1.80),
  Weight = c(70, 60, 80),
  Age = c(52, 18, 34)
)
print(BMI)
```

## Get your Data into R

```{r}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

### Clean your Data & Re-shape it

Dplyr and the Pipe %\>% mpg - built in data set (miles per gallon)

```{r}
mpg %>% # pipes mpg to filter
  
dplyr::filter(model == "a4") %>% # return rows that satisfy condition

dplyr::arrange(year, cyl) %>% # reorder your columns

dplyr::mutate(old = year < 2000,
              full_wheel_drive = drv == 'f') %>% # add new preserve old

# dplyr::transmute("full_wheel_drive" = drv == "f") # add new drop old

dplyr::select(-drv) # keep or remove columns (all but drv)

mpg %>%
dplyr::count(model, sort = TRUE) # create aggregate stats
```
